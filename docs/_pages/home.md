Hello, everybody.

I'm Nuria Oyaga and this is the place where we will be putting the advances that are made on the work of end of master.

The objective of the work is to investigate different types of networks to find models that are capable of predicting movement dynamics, from simpler to more complex, in video frames.

The tutors of the project are:

- [Jose Maria Ca√±as](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/)
- [Inmaculada Mora](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/inmaculada.mora)
