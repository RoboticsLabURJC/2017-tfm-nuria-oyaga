## Proposed net

Continuing with the use of raw images recurrence propose the use of ConvLSTM layer resulting in the following net:

Before the recurrent layer, it is necessary to introduce a convolve to reduce the dimensionality of the data and make it more manageable.

## Linear dataset results

- 1 DOF, 8000 training samples, 1000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/lin_1DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Linear 1 DOF " %}

- 2 DOF, 8000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/lin_2DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Linear 2 DOF " %}

## Parabolic dataset results

- 1 DOF, 8000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/par_1DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Parabolic 1 DOF " %}

- 2 DOF, 8000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/par_2DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Parabolic 2 DOF " %}

- 3 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/par_3DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Parabolic 3 DOF " %}

## Sinusoidal dataset results

- 1 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/sin_1DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Sinusoidal 1 DOF " %}

- 2 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/sin_2DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Sinusoidal 2 DOF " %}

- 3 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/sin_3DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Sinusoidal 3 DOF " %}

- 4 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week18/sin_4DOF.png" alt="ConvLSTM-Sinusoidal 4 DOF " %}

## Conclusions

The results obtained are better than those of the CNN, although there is still a prediction limit in the prabolic 3 DOF and in the sinusoidal 2 DOF, although with a smaller error. It should also be noted that, although low average values are obtained, the maximums are high and there is a large presence of outliers that worsen the prediction.
