## Meeting summary
- It has been possible to refactor the code for training and testing the networks with modeled images.
- With all this, it is possible to advance in training research with these new data.
- In addition, the generation of the two new types of dynamics, parabolic and sinusoidal is resumed.
- On the other hand, the possibility of adding a new error analysis is considered, comparing errors in general and in the two possible dimensions (x, y)


## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [ ] Train and evaluate the networks with modeled data.
- [ ] Generate the datasets for the new dynamics: parabolic and sinusoidal.
- [X] Add to the code the global error comparison, in x and in y.
