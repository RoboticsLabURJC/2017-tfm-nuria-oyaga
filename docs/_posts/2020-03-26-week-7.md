## Meeting summary
- It has been possible to refactor the code for training and testing the networks with modeled images.
- With all this, it is possible to advance in training research with these new data.
- In addition, the generation of the two new types of dynamics, parabolic and sinusoidal is resumed.
- On the other hand, the possibility of adding a new error analysis is considered, comparing errors in general and in the two possible dimensions (x, y)


## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [X] Train and evaluate the networks with modeled data.
- [ ] Generate the datasets for the new dynamics: parabolic and sinusoidal.
- [X] Modify the error info and graphs for a better analysis.


## New error information
For a better analysis of the networks, the code has been modified so that the following information is obtained:

- A new file with the target position, the predicted position, and the global absolute and relative errors for that sample are evaluated sample by sample.
  
```ruby
    Processed sample 0: 
    Target position: [73 58]
    Position: [57 34]
    Error: 28.84 (20.0%)
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Processed sample 1: 
    Target position: [ 4 29]
    Position: [32 71]
    Error: 50.48 (35.0%)
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Processed sample 2: 
    Target position: [35 58]
    Position: [38 62]
    Error: 5.0 (3.47%)
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Processed sample 3: 
    Target position: [79 87]
    Position: [50 44]
    Error: 51.87 (35.96%)
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Processed sample 4: 
    Target position: [ 57 116]
    Position: [29 76]
    Error: 48.83 (33.85%)
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    ...
```
  
- An image with four graphics with different information about the error obtained:
  
  1. An absolute global error histogram
  2. A relative global error histogram
  3. A series of boxplots showing breakdown error: global, *x* and *y*, absolute and relative.
  4. A summary of the global error with the sample that has produced the greatest error.
