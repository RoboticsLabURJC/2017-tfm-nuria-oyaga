## Meeting summary
- The main objective of the week of training with more samples of raw images could not be achieved because memory complications arose when reading the dataset.

## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [ ] Train LSTM networks with more samples in linear movement dataset with 3 degrees of freedom with more samples (100000).
- [ ] Train ConvLSTM networks with more samples in linear movement dataset with 3 degrees of freedom with more samples(100000).
- [X] Network training code refactoring for new data structure.
- *[X]* Re-train the networks with the 10000 sample dataset for consistency in results.
