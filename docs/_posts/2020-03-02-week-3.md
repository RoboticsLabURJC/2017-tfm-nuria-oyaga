## Meeting summary
- The main objective of the week of training with more samples of raw images could not be achieved because memory complications arose when reading the dataset.
- The training code has been adapted to use the new data structure.
- When there is a lack of coherence in the results obtained so far with the dataset that reflects a linear movement with three degrees of freedom (speed, slope and starting point), the networks and evaluations of them have been regenerated with the dataset of 10000 samples.
- It is decided to continue with the investigation of adapting the code to be able to read the dataset by batches and to be able to train with the dataset of 100000 samples the networks

## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [X] Adapt the code to read the dataset by batches.
- [ ] Refactor the evaluation code for the new data structure.
