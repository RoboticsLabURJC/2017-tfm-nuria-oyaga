## Meeting summary
- We have observed that the results of networks trained with modeled data are not as good as they should be.
- After analyzing the structure of the networks we realize that the main problem is that have not been used the most suitable layers and activation functions for the problem.
- For this reason we decided to continue testing with different structures that allow us to improve the results.
- On the other hand, we prioritize the objective of creating new data with different dynamics that allow us to advance in the roadmap.

## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [X] Generate the datasets with parabolic dynamic.
- [X] Generate the datasets with sinusoidal dynamic.
- [ ] Try tu optimize the results in networks with modeled data.
