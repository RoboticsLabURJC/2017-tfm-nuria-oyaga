## Meeting summary
- The item established for this week of generating modeled samples and raw samples has been fulfilled.
- With this new type of data, the range of possibilities is widened so that we can play with the degree of complexity of the movement, the type of network used and the two types of images to be used both as input and output.
- To focus the goal of the week we decided to focus on linear movement with three degrees of freedom (speed, slope and initial position), using the LSTM and ConvLSTM networks, and using raw images as input and output.
- We will increase the number of samples in training based on the results obtained previously since the number of parameters is very high due to the use of raw images.
- Analyzing what we know so far, it is expected that the network will not have a good performance with this type of data, so in the next steps we would change the input and output for the modeled images, thus reducing the number of parameters that manage the network.

## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [ ] Train LSTM networks with more samples in linear movement dataset with 3 degrees of freedom with more samples.
- [ ] Train ConvLSTM networks with more samples in linear movement dataset with 3 degrees of freedom with more samples.
