## Proposed net

I have defined an MLP network to address prediction with modeled images and non-recurrent networks. The defined network is as follows:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/NOREC_simple_mod.png" alt="MLP Net" %}

## Linear dataset results

- 1 DOF, 8000 training samples, 1000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/lin_1DOF.png" alt="MLP-Linear 1 DOF " %}

- 2 DOF, 8000 training samples, 1000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/lin_2DOF.png" alt="MLP-Linear 2 DOF " %}

## Parabolic dataset results

- 1 DOF, 8000 training samples, 1000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/par_1DOF.png" alt="MLP-Parabolic 1 DOF " %}

- 2 DOF, 8000 training samples, 1000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/par_2DOF.png" alt="MLP-Parabolic 2 DOF " %}

- 3 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/par_3DOF.png" alt="MLP-Parabolic 3 DOF " %}

## Sinusoidal dataset results

- 1 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/sin_1DOF.png" alt="MLP-Sinusoidal 1 DOF " %}

- 2 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/sin_2DOF.png" alt="MLP-Sinusoidal 2 DOF " %}

- 3 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/sin_3DOF.png" alt="MLP-Sinusoidal 3 DOF " %}

- 4 DOF, 80000 training samples, 10000 test samples
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/logbook/week9/sin_4DOF.png" alt="MLP-Sinusoidal 4 DOF " %}

## Conclusions

Good results are achieved in all dynamics until reaching the sinusoidal with 2 DOF. In this motion the results worsen and the network begins to lose prediction capacity.
