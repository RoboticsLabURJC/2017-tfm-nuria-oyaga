## Meeting summary
- All the planned training sessions have been carried out, obtaining a fairly reasonable result on the NoRNN and ConvLSTM networks, and poor performance on the LSTM networks.
- With these results we decided to discard the LSTM network due to its low performance and focus on the other two types.
- On the other hand we decided to put the focus back on the modeled images to make a comparison of the performance and expecting quite good results in view of what has been obtained so far.
- The possibility of analyzing two other types of dynamics is also established: parabolic and sinusoidal.


## To Do
The tasks proposed for this week are

- [X] Refactor the code to be able to train and evaluate the networks with modeled data.
- [ ] Generate the datasets for the new dynamics: parabolic and sinusoidal

## Code refactoring
